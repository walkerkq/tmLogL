Title: Log Likelihood Function for Text Mining
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors: person(“Kaylin”, “Walker”, email = “walkerkq2@gmail.com”, role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This function allows you to compare the log 
    likelihood of words between groups. To use, you must
    supply the grouping variable, text variable and group of interest.
    The function compares the expected frequency of words in the group of interest
    and remaining text to the observed frequency. Words with high log likelihood
    "surprisingly" occur more in the group of interest, while words with negative 
    log likelihood occur less often than expected in the group of interest.
